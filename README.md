# BioNeos-Decompress
This is the code for the third challenge. It is a Django-based web app that is currently hosted here: https://decompres.herokuapp.com/decompress/

The app lets you decompress a simple message then store it in a database.

The Django project has two apps: URLProject which is the main app where the settings are, and Shortner app where you can find the decompresing logic and the UI.
The code for performing the decompression and the database communication is under Shortner>views.py
The ui form is located under Shortner>templates
