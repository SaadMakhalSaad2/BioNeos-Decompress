# BioNeos-Decompress
This is the code for the third challenge. It is a Django-based web app that is currently hosted here:

The app does two main functions: it lets you decompress a simple message then store it in a database.

The Django project has two apps: the main app called URLProject and the decompressor app called Shortner.
To find the code for performing the compressing and the database communication navigate to Shortner>view.py
